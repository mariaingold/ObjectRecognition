UoEO Machine Learning  
Machine Learning Individual Project using CIFAR-10 dataset  

# AUTHOR

Maria Ingold  

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Machine learning model addresses:
1. Partition method: Validation set from training data; provide metadata insights
2. Validation set: Why create.
3. Architecture: Explain Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
4. Activation function: Why selected      
5. Loss function: Why and what.
6. Epochs and Batch Size: Number used
7. Neural Network design: Explain strategy
8. Reflection: Learnings acquired
