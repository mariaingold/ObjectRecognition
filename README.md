# NEURAL NETWORK MODELS FOR OBJECT RECOGNITION

UoEO Machine Learning  
Machine Learning Individual Project using CIFAR-10 dataset  

# AUTHOR

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Machine learning model addresses:
1. Partition method: Validation set from training data; provide metadata insights
2. Validation set: Why create.
3. Architecture: Explain Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
4. Activation function: Why selected      
5. Loss function: Why and what.
6. Epochs and Batch Size: Number used
7. Neural Network design: Explain strategy
8. Reflection: Learnings acquired

## USAGE

### USING
* Load pre-created model file into Google Colab: models\model_5_best.keras

### RUNNING CODE FOR EACH MODEL
* Each model section is independent so it can be tested separately.  
* Delete runtime before running each model. 
* Alternatively can load model from model directory, as above. 

## Dataset

Uses inbuilt Keras CIFAR-10 dataset.
